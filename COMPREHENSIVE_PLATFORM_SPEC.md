# Comprehensive Multi-Platform Website - Complete Specification

## Project Vision

I want to build the most comprehensive wellness, education, and e-commerce platform that serves every possible population with personalized content, assessments, courses, products, and services. This platform should combine all features from AFYA Wellness with expanded capabilities for blogging, advanced learning management, extensive booking systems, and comprehensive e-commerce. The platform must be modular, scalable, and serve diverse populations with specialized content and pathways.

## Development Philosophy

Build Like Lego: Start with simple, stable foundations and add complexity incrementally. Each component must be solid and tested before moving forward. Prioritize stability over feature completeness initially, then layer on advanced features once core functionality is proven.
